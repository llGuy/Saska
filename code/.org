* Engine refactor
** Rendering
  + Add draw arrays to rendering pipeline
  + Redo graphics submission queue to take into account draw arrays vs draw elements
  + Make mesh for the voxel chunk (first do point rendering)
  + Get voxel points to render
  + Create debug movement to view the new world
  + Create structure to have multiple chunks
  + Create triangle mesh of each chunk
  + Render them separately
  + Create sphere(s)
  + Terraforming on new terrain system
** Gameplay
  + Start to implement new physics
  + Rolling vs entity mode : up vector / gravity
  + Collide and slide
  + Find cool ways to create wacky worlds : procedural generation, etc...
** New entity renderer
  + Load new entity model
  + Add texture
  + Work on new animation system : blend animations that affect different parts of the body (walk, shoot, etc...)
** Networking
